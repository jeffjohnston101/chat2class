chat2class: iOS Client Application
======================================

chat2class (C2C) is a client/server application designed and developed for my Studio classes (SE491 and SE591) at DePaul University.  

C2C is a 'Twitter-like' client/server application for classmates.  The concept was to create an application that allowed classmates to share information and contact one another regarding any and all matters associated with the classes they have in common.  It also allows faculty to contact all members of the class via a 'Twitter-like' notification to help communicate timely and topical information.  It allows sub-groups to form within a class.  And most importantly, it allows classmates to get to know one another and share skills and knowledge easily. 

My classmate and teammate, John Schrantz, and I were responsible for the design and development of the iOS client application for C2C. 

This client application was built in Objective-C using Xcode.  The server-side was built in Java and deployed on the Google App Engine.  The two communicate using RESTful calls that primarily pass JSON objects containing the necessary data.
